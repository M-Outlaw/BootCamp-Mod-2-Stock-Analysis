# Stock Analysis with VBA
Performing analysis on stock values to determine which is the best investment

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis to use VBA to help determin which stock would be the best to invest in based on stock data from 2017 and 2018. We are helping Steve review stocks and determine which stock would be best for his parents to invest in.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Data
The data provided stock information for 12 different stocks for years 2017 and 2018. To better understand the stock data, we focused first on examining the data for just one stock during 2018. Steve's parents have an interest in the DAQO (DQ) stock, so this is the stock we will analyze first.

## DQ Analysis
-VBA code was created to determine the Total Daily volume and the percent return that DQ had during 2018. 
  * The code ran through all of the rows of the 2018 stock data. It looked for every instance of DQ and added the total number of shares traded each day. 
  * It also determined the starting price for the year and the ending price for the year to then determine the percent return over the year.
